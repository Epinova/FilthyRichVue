# FilthyRichVue

> Rich text editors are cool and all. But some times, rich isn't rich enough. That's why we created the fithy rich editor instead. It allow you to do anything, utilizing the unlimited power of Vue.js, leizm-html-parser and common JSON models.

## Usage
```javascript
<template>
  <div>
  <filthy-rich-vue />
  </div>
</template>
<script>
import filthyRichVue from '@epinova/filthy-rich-vue'

export default {
  components: {
    filthyRichVue
  },
  ...
```
